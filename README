It has always been a pain to deal with cross browser issues of the window's resize event.
According to PPK(1):
- In IE, Safari, and Chrome many resize events fire as long as the user continues resizing the window.
- Opera uses as many resize events, but fires them all at the end of the resizing.
- Firefox fires one resize event at the end of the resizing.

Following Paul Irish's smartresize plugin(2), here is the smart resize special event(3)

Simply bind your smartresize event just like a normal resize event. The handler will be executed only once at the end of the resize event:

$(window).bind("smartresize", function( event ) {
	// Your event handler code goes here.
	
});

// equivalent to...
$(window).smartresize(function( event ) {
	// Your event handler code goes here.
	
});

To trigger the smartresize event without and cancelling the debulk timeout (100ms), use the following snippet:
$(window).smartresize();
// or...
$(window).trigger("smartresize", ["execAsap"]);
